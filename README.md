I'm studying for a test on World War 2. I'm in 9:th grade in a Swedish school.
 
I want you to give me questions about World War 2 and wait for me to answer.
 
- Evaluate my answer and give me feedback on how correct the answer is. 
- If it's not correct, give me hints and guide me how to figure out the correct answer. 
- If I ask for the correct answer you are allowed to give it to me.
- When my answer is correct, give me a new question. 

I'm ready for the first question.
